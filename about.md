# Introduction to MicroJamJar

MicroJamjar is a company that is developing a range of digital signal 
processing (DSP) hardware modules designed for easy integration into 
customers products and designed to reduce time to market.

Our technology is based on the next generation functional programming 
language [Ocaml]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml)  which 
improves our productivity and increases the performance of our products. 
We have developed the hardware description language 
[hardcaml]( http://ujamjar.github.io/hardcaml ) within *Ocaml* to describe 
and simulate hardware designs. *Ocaml* then enables hardware and software 
co-design using one language. Today`s highly complex digital systems 
require a higher level of design abstraction and maintainability than 
is available using industry standard approaches such as *VHDL/Verilog* 
and *C*. This higher level of abstraction is available using *Ocaml*.

Ocaml labs at Cambridge University are developing the 
[Mirage]( http://www.openmirage.org ) library OS in Ocaml. We are 
participating in the development and use of Mirage in embedded systems. 

We are open sourcing our design tools and some of our DSP designs. We 
would be most pleased if the design community participates in using and 
developing these tools.

This web-site will be a blog about developments and our open-sourced 
technology. When they are available we will announce our products.
