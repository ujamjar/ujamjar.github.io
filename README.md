# Categories

The blog are organised by some special categories.  In general you can 
have multiple categories and they can be anything sensible (though
tags should be used for generally describing posts).

The main categories the website respects are

* 'products' - goes to special front page product section
* 'open-source' - goes to special front page open-source section
* 'ocaml' - gets added to the ocaml.xml feed
* anything else - treated as a standard blog post ie 'demo', 'blog', 'tutorial' and so on

The main point is to seperate out products and open-source from the 
list of blogs on the front page and avoid repeating information.
